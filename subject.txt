Assignemnt name : vbc
expected file : *.c *.h
Allowed fonctions : malloc, calloc, realloc, free, printf, isdigit, write

Write a programme that will print the result of a math expression given as argument.
You must handle the operator + * and the parenthesis.
You don't have to handle white space in the expression.
All the value are in 0 - 9.
In case of inexpected symbole, you will print : "Unexpected tocken'%c'\n"
and exit whith the code 1 (if the symbole is the end of input you will
print "Unexpected end of input\n")
this rule also apply in case you find an unexpexted '(' or ')'.
In case of a syscall failure you will just exit whith the code 1.

exemples :
./vbc '1'| cat -e
1$
./vbc '2+3'| cat -e
5$
./vbc '(((((2+2*2+2)*2+2)*2+2)*2+2)*2+2)*2'| cat -e
188$
./vbc '1+'
unexpected end of input
./vbc '1+2)'
Unexpected token ')'$
